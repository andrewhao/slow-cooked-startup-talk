### Way back in 2006...

### ⏳🌀🌌

???

A lot happens in 2006:

- The Cardinals defeat the Tigers in the World Series
- Steelers defeat the Seahawks 
- The DJIA breaks 12000 for the first time
- Democrats gain control of both houses of congress in midterm elections, largely seen as a referendum on the war in Iraq. This makes Pres. George W. Bush a lame-duck president.
- Google buys YouTube for 1.65 billion, to much criticism from cynics who claim the unprofitable startup will quickly fail
- The housing market bursts, kicking off a subprime mortgage crisis...
- And I and a few friends were still rising juniors in university in a dusty cubicle farm in Fremont, CA...
