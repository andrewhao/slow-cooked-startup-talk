#### Part I:

### How to start

---

class: middle

##### How to start

# Find a problem

#### Find _your_ problem

???

Everybody has their own unique problem to address in their lives.

A pain point. Some friction.

- Scheduling child care,
- or managing your finances well,
- or finding people who are available to play pickup soccer,
- or knowing whether a food is free from allergens

#### My task:

Coordinate signups for a vigil event across several campus groups

--

Highly manual process.

---

class: middle

##### How to start

# Find a solution

#### Can it be solved with technology?

- Aggregate information from disparate sources?
- Digitize a previously-manual workflow?
- Automate a tedious task?

---

class: middle

#### My solution:

Build an online signup sheet for the event!

---

class: middle

#### My tech stack:

PHP, MySQL, and a little technology known as AJAX

???

I knew a little bit of PHP, a little bit of MySQL. I hosted it on the campus computing center hosting services

---

class: middle

##### How to start

# Make it useful ASAP

Otherwise it sits in a corner, gathering dust.

---

class: middle

Coded in a sleepless evening

---

class: middle

Tons of ugly code.

---

class: middle

And Googled to hack together everything else.

---

class: middle

The signup process went smoothly and the event was successful!

---

##### How to start

# Success metrics

- Did it solve your problem?
- Are other people interested?
- Who else needs to know about and use your project?

---

class: middle

#### Feedback:

"Can we use it?" - other campus groups

## Fast forward to 2006...

### ⏳🌀🌌

???

A lot happens in 2006:

- The Cardinals defeat the Tigers in the World Series
- Steelers defeat the Seahawks 
- The DJIA breaks 12000 for the first time
- Democrats gain control of both houses of congress in midterm elections, largely seen as a referendum on the war in Iraq. This makes Pres. George W. Bush a lame-duck president.
- Google buys YouTube for 1.65 billion, to much criticism from cynics who claim the unprofitable startup will quickly fail
- The housing market bursts, kicking off a subprime mortgage crisis...
- And I and a few friends were still rising juniors in university in a dusty cubicle farm in Fremont, CA...

## Hello Rails!

#### Very hip! Insanely productive!

???

But actually at this startup is where I first got my early exposure to Rails. A productive framework for making software, I soon saw how quickly and how easily you could build things!

---

class: middle

#### Reframing the problem:

Coordinating volunteers is difficult!

---

class: middle

#### The process is:

- Paper- or email-based
- Highly manual & error-prone
- Unidirectional
- No single source of truth

---

class: middle center

## Round 2!

Solve a *more general problem*

--
<br />
...in a technology *I want to learn*

???

But this time, I did things differently.
